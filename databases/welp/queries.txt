There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
    SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
   ...> FROM reviews
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;
