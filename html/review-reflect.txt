Briefly describe your understanding of what the browser does, including definitions of the following:

A web browser is a type of software people use to access web pages.  For a user to view a web page, they type the web address into the browser. 

    client - the device a person is using to access websites (computer, laptop, cell phone, tablet, etc)

    server - a computer that is continuously connected to the internet which hosts the website. The user is essentially using their device to ask the browser for a web page - that request is set across the Internet and returns the request to the client

    render - using computer programs to generate an image
What is HTML? In your answer, include definitions of the following:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is one of the languages a browser speaks, and tells the web browser how to display the text, images, and other content of a web page
    tag - to display text, images, and other content on a web page you must put that information between opening and closing tags - the symbol between the tag tells the tags purpose
    element - "tags" and "elements" are sometimes used interchangeably.  However, the element is the content the exists between opening and closing tags (and the tags themselves) - the information between opening and closing tags gives that content special meaning
    node - everything within an HTML document is a node - from the complete document itself, the elements, the text, the attributes, and comments
    attribute - attributes are created within the opening tag and consist of a 'name' and a 'value' - most attribute values are predetermined and provide extra information and settings for the element
    block element - block level elements have a page break built in before and after the element
    inline element - only takes up the space on the page that is between the element tags
Very briefly, explain the purpose of the following elements:
    head - area where you can define the title of the html page. does not appear in web page itself
    body - area that contains at documentation for HTML web page
    p- paragraph, holds descriptive text
    form - creates a form for users input value of different types
    div - divides content into sections
    span - used in tables for content to span a number of columns or rows
    select - used in forms to create drop down menu of options
    h2 - creates a heading and can range in sizes
    ol - lists that will be numbered
    ul - lists that will be bulleted
    table - created a table
    tr - defines what will be placed in a row
    td - defines what will be place in each column of a row
