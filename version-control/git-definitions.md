# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system to track all changes to your source code. It was very useful because it is a solid form of distributed development. I can have other people working on a project and see all changes made by date, name time and etc. Also with certain accesses restricted I can approve all changes made to the file. Worst case scenario we can always revert back 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branches are very important in Git/Github. When you want to add a new feature to your master code but do not want to risk ruining the file you can create a branch. It works separately from your master file but has all the same code in it from your final commit in the master repo. Using a branch ensures you can play around adding new features without ruining your original file. Once your branch is mature enough and you know it will work you can merge it to the master file. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you are basically giving yourself a restore point in your code. Once you have done enough work you need to save the work with commit. When you save your work you also get to put a commit message. What makes a good message is that it is specific to what you have added or changed. If you added a new feature to an app you would say what that feature was. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when git cannot figure out how to merge the new changes made . This could be because two users edited the same file and gave two different lines of code, or another person submitted a merge with files deleted that you worked on. If this happens git wont know which file to use so there is a conflict!
