key design philosophies of the Linux operating system
- Nine major tenets

- There are nine major tenets to the Linux philosophy.
    + Small is Beautiful
    + Each Program Does One Thing Well
        * These two tenets go hand in hand. Each of the commands in this program is fairly small, and each performs a specific task. The sort command, for example does only one thing. It sorts the data stream sent to it via Standard Input and sends the results to Standard Output. It can perform numeric, alphabetic and alphanumeric sorts in forward and reverse order. But it does nothing else. It only sorts but it is very, very good at that.
    + Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
        * The portability of shell scripts can be far more efficient in the long run than the perceived efficiency of writing a program in a compiled language—not even considering the time required to compile and test such a program—because they can run on many otherwise incompatible systems.
    + Make Every Program a Filter
        * Each of the commands that make up this command line program is a filter. That is each command will take an input, usually from Standard Input, and “filters” the data stream by making some change to it, then sends the resulting data stream to Standard Output. Standard Input and Standard Output are known collectively as STDIO.
    + Prototype as Soon as Possible
    + Store Data in Flat Text Files
    + Use Software Leverage
    + Choose Portability Over Efficiency
    + Avoid Captive User Interfaces

what is a VPS (virtual private server)?
- Chunk of memory that acts like a computer
- Runs own OS, own files, etc
- Basically a computer without the hardware
what are the advantages of using a VPS?
- cheaper
- scalable 
- more control
